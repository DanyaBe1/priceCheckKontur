A web application for a price checker in a store. 
The standard algorithm involves a person scanning a barcode on a product 
to obtain information about that product. 
The SQLite product database is populated automatically using a request 
to the store's cash register API. In addition to the standard functionality, 
there are features for updating and completely rewriting the database. 
The front-end is built using the Electron framework, while the backend is written in Java using JDBC, Servlets, and Log4j.
